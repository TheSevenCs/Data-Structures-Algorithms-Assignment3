# Data Structures & Algorithms Assignment 3 - Binary Search Trees (BST)

## Overview
This project implements Binary Search Tree (BST) operations in C, showcasing tree-based data management and traversal techniques. The code is modular, with separate components for tree nodes and operations.

## Features
- Create and manage binary search trees.
- Perform insertions, deletions, and searches efficiently.
- Modular structure with separate tree node handling.

## Technologies
- **Language:** C  
- **IDE:** Visual Studio

## How to Run
1. Open the project in Visual Studio.  
2. Build and run the solution.  
3. Use the `main.c` to interact with the BST functionality.
